# The Fellas — Landing Page

A simple, fast, and modern landing page for **The Fellas**, an online retail shop based in **Groveland, MA**. Owner: **Luis Guarana**.

## Quick Start

1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Replace placeholder emails/URLs (`hello@thefellas.shop`, `example.com`) with your real ones.
4. (Optional) Update the Google Maps embed in the About section with a precise pickup point.

## One‑click deploy (free)

- **Netlify** (easiest): Drag‑and‑drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop
- **Vercel**: Create a new project and import this folder.
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repo and enable Pages (root, main branch).

## Custom domain & email

- Point your domain (e.g., `thefellas.shop`) to Netlify/Vercel and add an email forwarder like Cloudflare Email Routing or use a provider (Zoho, Google Workspace).

## Forms

The newsletter and contact forms use Formspree demo endpoints. Replace with your own (free) endpoint from https://formspree.io/ for production, or connect to your backend.

## Edit the theme

- Colors and spacing live in `:root` tokens inside `styles.css`.
- Logo is an editable SVG at `assets/logo.svg`.

## SEO

- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` included.
